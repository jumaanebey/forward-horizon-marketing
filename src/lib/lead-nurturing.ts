I wanted to follow up on your interest in our veterans housing program. 

**Quick question:** What's your biggest concern about finding stable housing right now?

Many veterans tell me their main worries are:
‚Ä¢ Finding a place that understands military background
‚Ä¢ Navigating VA benefits for housing assistance
‚Ä¢ Getting into a supportive community environment

**I'd like to offer you a quick 10-minute call** to discuss how we can specifically help with your situation. 

When would be a good time for you today or tomorrow? I have openings at:
- Today: 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM
- Tomorrow: 10:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:30 PM

Just reply with your preferred time, or call me directly at (626) 603-0954.

Honor and respect,

I haven't heard back from you, but I wanted to make sure you know I'm still here if you need housing assistance.

Sometimes veterans feel hesitant to reach out again, but please know:
‚Ä¢ There's no pressure or obligation
‚Ä¢ Our conversation is completely confidential
‚Ä¢ We work at YOUR pace, on YOUR timeline

**One simple question:** Would a 5-minute text conversation be easier than a phone call?

I can text you at {{phone}} if that feels more comfortable, or you can reply to this email with just a "yes" or "no" to let me know you're still interested.

Your service matters, and so does your housing stability.

Semper Fi,
