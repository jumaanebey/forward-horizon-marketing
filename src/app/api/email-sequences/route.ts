      body: `Hi {firstName},

I hope you've had a chance to review your Veterans Benefits Guide. Many veterans don't realize they're missing out on benefits they've earned.

Here are 3 quick actions you can take this week:

‚úÖ Check your VA disability rating - you may be eligible for an increase
‚úÖ Apply for your Certificate of Eligibility for VA home loans
‚úÖ Look into VASH housing vouchers if you're currently struggling with housing

At Forward Horizon, we specialize in helping veterans navigate these systems. Our staff includes veterans who understand the process firsthand.

Ready to take the next step? 
Call us at (626) 603-0954 or visit theforwardhorizon.com

We're here to serve those who served.

      body: `Hi {firstName},

I wanted to share James's story with you. James is an Army veteran who came to Forward Horizon after struggling with housing instability for months.

"I was living out of my car and felt like I'd hit rock bottom. Forward Horizon didn't just give me a place to stay - they helped me get my VA benefits sorted out, found me a job, and gave me back my dignity." - James S.

Today, James has his own apartment, a steady job, and is mentoring other veterans in our program.

Your situation might be different, but you deserve the same level of support and respect.

If you're ready to talk about your next steps, call us at (626) 603-0954. We have openings in our veterans program right now.

      body: `Hi {firstName},

Recovery is a daily choice, and I'm proud of you for taking this step.

Here's something important: the first 90 days are crucial. Having a structured, sober environment makes all the difference in building lasting sobriety.

Three things that successful residents tell us helped them most:

üåü Living with others who understand the struggle
üåü Having clear expectations and accountability
üåü Access to support 24/7 when cravings hit

At Forward Horizon, we've helped over 250 people build successful, sober lives. Our residents have an 89% success rate because we understand that recovery is about more than just staying clean - it's about building a new life.

      body: `Hi {firstName},

I want to share Maria's story because it shows that recovery is possible, even after multiple attempts.

Maria came to us after her third relapse. She was scared, ashamed, and convinced she'd never get it right.

"Forward Horizon saved my life. The community here doesn't just help you stay sober‚Äîthey help you rebuild everything. I have a job, an apartment, and most importantly, hope." - Maria R.

Today, Maria has 2 years of sobriety and works as a peer counselor helping others in early recovery.

What made the difference? She says it was having people who believed in her when she couldn't believe in herself.

We believe in you too, {firstName}.

Our next group intake is this week. Call (626) 603-0954 to learn more about joining our recovery community.

      subject: "Your 72-Hour Reentry Action Plan",
      body: `Hi {firstName},

Your re-entry journey starts with the first 72 hours, and having a plan makes all the difference.

Based on helping 180+ returning citizens, here are the most critical first steps:

Day 1: Get your ID and Social Security card replacement started
Day 2: Apply for benefits (SNAP, Medicaid) 
Day 3: Connect with a re-entry program for ongoing support

The biggest mistake people make? Trying to do everything alone.

At Forward Horizon, we've seen what works. Our residents have a 5% recidivism rate (compared to 68% nationally) because we address housing, employment, and support together.

David came to Forward Horizon directly from prison with $50 and a bus ticket. Today, 18 months later, he has his own apartment, a steady job, and is rebuilding his relationship with his daughter.

"Forward Horizon didn't just give me a place to stay‚Äîthey gave me a chance to prove to myself that I could change. The structure, the support, the belief that I could succeed - that made all the difference." - David M.

What made David successful:
‚Ä¢ Safe, stable housing during his transition
‚Ä¢ Help with documentation and benefits
‚Ä¢ Job placement with a second-chance employer  
‚Ä¢ Life skills training and financial literacy
